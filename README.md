# 🚀 QuickBizz – A Django-Based B2B Product Sharing Platform

Proud to present **QuickBizz**, a fully functional backend project built with Python Django.  
This project was completely **brainstormed, designed, and developed by me** to add a unique and real-world inspired system to my portfolio. 💡

---

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Python, Django
- **Database:** SQLite
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, Bootstrap

---

## 💼 Project Overview

**QuickBizz** is a B2B (Business-to-Business) platform that enables businesses to:

- Register their company and create a product listing
- Explore other businesses and their listed products
- Request products they don't currently have from other businesses
- Accept/reject product sharing requests
- Track requests and notify businesses accordingly

---

## 🛠️ The Problem

In the real market, not every business has every product readily available.  
When a customer requests something that isn’t in stock, businesses often **lose that opportunity** — and the sale goes to a competitor.

---

## 🎯 The Solution – QuickBizz

QuickBizz allows businesses to **collaborate rather than compete**.

✅ Register a business and list your available products  
✅ See what other businesses are offering  
✅ If you don't have a product your customer needs, request it from others  
✅ The sender business can accept or reject the request  
✅ If accepted, the product is delivered  
✅ After selling, the requesting business pays the full price **plus a commission** to the sender
